# What is the AAL?

The AAL is a a Software License which can be added to any Open Source or Closed Source software.

It expresses the wish that the software only be used for the betterment of humanity.

## What does AAL stand for?
AAL are the initials of [Augusta Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) - one of the pioneers of early computing.

This License is named in her memory.

* Augusta Ada Lovelace's
* Altruistic
* License

## Why is the AAL needed?

> We hear a lot about The Turing Test. What about a "Lovelace Test"; how will this machine benefit mankind?
>
> Dr Betty Toole - author of [Ada, The Enchantress of Numbers: Poetical Science](http://www.adatheenchantress.com/)
>
> Proposed at [Oxford University's Ada Lovelace Symposium](https://twitter.com/edent/status/674630957836673025)

**NB** This is unrelated to the similarly named [test for creativity in artificial intelligence ](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=596904)

## How is the AAL used?

[Moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism) tells us that there can be no universally accepted definition of moral or altruistic behaviour.

A vaccine, in the wrong hands may be a deadly weapon, a knife can be used to prepare food or [maim people](http://www.benkinsella.org.uk/), a nuclear missile may kill millions or [may well be used to save lives](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/).

This License does *not* restrict the way you use the software.  It asks that you respect the wishes of the software's author(s) and fully reflect on whether your use of the software is helping make the world a better place.

If it is not, the only punishment is your own guilt and to be held in opprobrium by those who follow this License.

## What is the text of the AAL?

TODO ;-)
